Description:
    This program takes a input and uses a hash table to map the input to dynamic array. When the user then wants to look up the 
    element, the hash function is able to find the correct element with O(1) average complexity. This is because the inputs
    are stores at a index that can be related to them by the hash function.
Instructions:
    cd into the program file using "cd assignment5copy" using the terminal. Then type into the terminal "make", look for the
    executable "test_ht" type this into the terminal. The program will run

Limitations:
    This program runs through the test_hash_table.c file, the user will not be able to input their own data
    into the hash table.
