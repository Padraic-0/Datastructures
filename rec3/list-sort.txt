In the sort function the list is able to be sorted until a seg fault. This seg fault come when the while loop runs. The current node has a val
but its next* is null. Non the less, the if statement compares the current val to the next nodes val. The next node is null, thus it has no val.
This causes the seg fault. To fix this, the while loop needs to be while(curr->next != NULL). The list will still be sorted because no other nodes exits when this statement is true.
